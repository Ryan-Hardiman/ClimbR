# islandclimbing

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

{islandclimbing} is a work in progress R package and shiny app to accompany the book *Guernsey Trad* by James Burton.
This app is for non-commercial use.

## Installation

You can install the development version of islandclimbing like so:

``` r
remotes::install_github("Ryan-Hardiman/Island_Climbing")
```

## Roadmap

The end goal is a Shiny app that will act as an interactive aide to the book.
It will not replace the book and will not include all the details that are in the book - you really need to get the book to get the most out of the app.

Climbing incurs some risk and you are responsible for your own safety.
