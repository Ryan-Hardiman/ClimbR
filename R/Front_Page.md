This is a placeholder for the eventual User Guide for the longstanding
Island Climbing project - a ditialisation of the Gsy Trad book by James
Burton. This application is aimed to be used in conjunction with, and
not in replace of, the Trad book. Information shown within this
application may be incorrect, particularly the avalability of some
climbs in respect to the tides USER BEWARE! By using this application
you accept that any shortfalls in planning, any injuries that occur, any
fun that you experiece. Does so by your action.

Now sit back, relax and enjoy this scrappy bit of code I threw together.
