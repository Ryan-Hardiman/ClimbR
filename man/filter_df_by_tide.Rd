\title{Filter Data Frame by Tide Conditions}
\usage{
filter_df_by_tide(df, start_time, duration)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A tibble or data frame containing the climbing routes data. It must have the following columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{tide_season}: Season of tide conditions (e.g., "All", "Spring").
\item \code{tide_heights}: Tide state (e.g., "Low", "High").
}}

\item{start_time}{Numeric value representing the start time for the climbing session in seconds.}

\item{duration}{Numeric value representing the duration of the climbing session in seconds.}
}
\value{
A filtered tibble or data frame containing only the climbing routes that are accessible during the
specified time frame, based on tide conditions.
}
\description{
Filters a data frame of climbing routes based on tide conditions at a specified start time and duration.
The function checks tide data, interpolates the tide heights over time, and determines whether the tide
is within the acceptable range for climbing, filtering out any routes that are inaccessible based on tide
height and season.
}
\examples{
# Assuming `df` is a tibble containing climbing route information
filtered_df <- filter_df_by_tide(df, start_time = 16250, duration = 3600)
